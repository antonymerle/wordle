# Wordle
This is a simple wordle game written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
It relies on a public API for getting random english words, however french words are random generated from a static dictionary. Although some of the words may seem weird (they maybe old or coming from some technical field) they are correct. I plan to filter the most common words.

# How to play
⚡️⚡️ Guess the wordle in 6 tries ! ⚡️⚡️
🔍️ Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
✏️ The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
✅ If the tile is green, the letter is in the word AND in the correct spot.
💡 If the tile is yellow, the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
🙈 If the tile is grey, the letter is not in the word.

# Cheating
You could cheat by looking in the browser console. But you won't. Right ?
